# Flutter Media Picker Package

This Flutter package provides a media picker widget that allows users to select images from their device's camera roll or gallery, as well as capture new photos using their device's camera.

The media picker widget is designed to resemble the media picker in Telegram, with a preview of the camera viewfinder, a list of recently captured media, and a folder selector. Once the user selects a media item, a crop tool will appear to allow them to crop the image before submitting it.
